Hey Thomas, 

Just read your letter, I think it was #2 letter to the family. It sounds like you’re having a typical time in the Army, from what I’ve remembered. When you’re out of your usual element - away from family, control of your time, in a clean environment - things get stressful and depressing. It becomes harder to work with people in your unit. 

I want encourage you start thinking like a leader now. These "knuckleheads" (which I say with a hint of affection) are the types of people you will be leading in the future. You have natural ability to look out for others - make sure you're doing for the guy next you.
